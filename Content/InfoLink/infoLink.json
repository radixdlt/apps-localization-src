One special kind of token on Radix is [XRD](?glossaryAnchor=xrd).\n\n---\n\nThe [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) has special features specifically to make the creation and use of tokens on Radix safe and predictable, and the [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) can automatically provide useful information about the tokens you hold in your [Accounts](?glossaryAnchor=accounts).\n\nUsually “token” is used specifically to refer to assets that are all alike. For example, one XRD token is exactly the same as any other XRD token.

  "infoLink_glossary_networkstaking": "## Radix Network Staking\n\nAn important feature of the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) is that users can “stake” [XRD tokens](?glossaryAnchor=xrd) to increase the security of the network, and be rewarded for doing so.\n\n---\n\nThe process involves choosing one or more [validators](?glossaryAnchor=validators) to stake to, and then doing a [transaction](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) to send some XRD to the network to support those validators. You can unstake the XRD later to get them back – and you’ll find that you accumulated extra XRD in the meantime.\n\nThe extra XRD you earn is proportional to how much XRD you stake, and is often called an “APY” (annual percentage yield).\n\nYou can stake, unstake, and check on your validators and APY returns using the [Radix Dashboard](?glossaryAnchor=dashboard) dApp.\n\nStaking is a great way to put your XRD to work and earn a return, but it’s **not simply free money**. Choosing validators is like voting for who will run the Radix Network. If you choose a bad validator, you might help slow down the network or even help attack it. And you might not get the APY you expect.\n\nGet started with the links below before you stake a meaningful amount of XRD.\n\n[Introduction to Radix staking](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/start-here-radix-staking-introduction) ↗\n\n[Learn how to choose validators](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/how-should-i-choose-validators-to-stake-to) ↗",

  "infoLink_glossary_dapps": "## dApps\n\nDecentralized applications, or dApps, are basically any application that makes use of web3 features.\n\n---\n\nIn web3, users control their own digital assets and identity. That’s much different from typical webpages and other apps today. For example, to access your money, you have to do it through a banking or payments app. Your login to every website is owned by that website, or else you use something like your Google login, which is owned by Google.\n\nBut in web3, you can hold your money in an [account](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) that you control directly with a [wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) app, and you can create your own [login](?glossaryAnchor=personas) in your wallet app and use that in many places.\n\nDoing things that way is “decentralized” – and it means that websites and applications need to be built specially to interact with wallet apps, self-owned accounts, and self-owned logins. That’s what makes them dApps.\n\nIn the end, web3 dApps can do many things that were never possible before. For example, a [decentralized exchange](?glossaryAnchor=dex) dApp can let you instantly swap between two different kinds of assets right from your wallet in just a tap.\n\n[Visit the Radix dApp Ecosystem Page](https://www.radixdlt.com/ecosystem) ↗",
  "infoLink_glossary_guarantees": "## Deposit Guarantees\n\nSome Radix [transactions](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) may have unpredictable results. In these cases, deposit guarantees make sure you never get less than you expect when you do a transaction.\n\n---\n\nFor example, the result of a swap between assets using a [DEX](?glossaryAnchor=dex) depends on a current market price of the assets involved. You may see one price when considering the swap, but it typically changes by the time the network processes it. Deposit guarantees protect you by letting you specify a minimum amount that must be deposited to your account at the end of the swap transaction.\n\nTo make this possible, the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) app and [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) work together. The wallet will show you whenever a deposit to your account is “estimated” rather than of a known quantity. And whenever that's true, you can set your own “guarantees” in the wallet on those estimated deposits – putting a limit on how much you expect to get for you to be willing to go through with the transaction. If that guarantee isn't met at the time the transaction is processed, the deal is off! The transaction is rejected by the Radix Network and no assets change hands.\n\n[Learn more about deposit guarantees](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/what-are-customizable-transaction-guarantees-on-radix) ↗",
  "infoLink_glossary_badges": "## Badges\n\nRadix Badges are tokens or NFTs that are used to prove their holder is authorized to claim something, access something or perform a certain action within the Radix Network. Any token on Radix can be used as a badge, but dApps may often create special tokens specifically for use as a badge.\n\n---\n\n[Tokens](?glossaryAnchor=tokens) and [NFTs](?glossaryAnchor=nfts) can represent almost anything. The [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) makes it possible to use ownership of a token or NFT to authorize the holder to access to certain [dApp](?glossaryAnchor=dapps) functionality. Tokens or NFTs used in this way are referred to as “badges”, indicating that only the holder of the badge can use it for authorization.\n\nWhen a badge is used to authorize access in a [transaction](?glossaryAnchor=transactions), you will see it listed in the [Radix Wallet’s](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) summary of the transaction under “presenting”. The badge isn’t being sent anywhere; all that’s happening is that you are providing proof that you own the badge.\n\n[Learn more about Radix badges](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/whats-a-badge) ↗",
  "infoLink_glossary_poolunits": "## Pool Units\n\nPool units are fungible [tokens](?glossaryAnchor=tokens) that represent the proportional size of a user's contribution to a liquidity pool\n\nPool units are redeemable for the user's portion of the pool but can also be traded, sold and used in DeFi applications.\n\n---\n\nLiquidity pools play an integral role in lending and swapping on DeFi platforms. They work by liquidity providers (LPs) contributing tokens to a pool, thus creating a market for people to lend, borrow and swap. In return, these LPs receive tokens to show they've made a contribution to the pool. LPs usually get rewarded for their contributions in the form of fees paid by the people using the DeFi platform to swap and borrow crypto, but there are other ways for them to earn revenue.\n\nWith other wallets on other blockchains, this process raises risks. Other wallets can’t tell an LP what the tokens they received for providing liquidity are worth. Other wallets can’t even be sure they are actually tokens that represent a portion of a pool or that the tokens are redeemable. They don’t provide any confidence.\n\nThe [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) solves this with a native package called a “pool”. This package automatically implements the logic of minting and burning pool units in the proportion to other LPs’ contributions. It also means your [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) can always read what your pool units are worth and ensures they’re always redeemable for tokens from the liquidity pool.\n\n[Learn more about pool units](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/what-are-pool-units-or-native-lp-tokens) ↗",

Each gateway will connect your wallet to a particular network. The Radix Network (known as “mainnet”) is the primary network where all real assets, including the real XRD of value, are located. However a gateway might target a test network (like “Stokenet”) where developers can experiment with updates and new features before they go live on Bablyon. None of the assets on these test networks, including XRD, have any value.\n\nThe [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) comes automatically connected to a Radix Network mainnet gateway operated by the creators of the Radix Wallet, but there are community-run gateways that users can choose to use as well.

This extension provides a QR code to scan with your Radix Wallet, which setting up a connection between your Radix Wallet and your desktop browser.\n\nThe connection is fully end-to-end encrypted and is also peer-to-peer, meaning there will be no centralized server holding your data or sending your messages back and forth.\n\nOn mobile, the process is even easier. dApps in your mobile browser can directly connect to your Radix Wallet app running on the same phone.\n\n[Learn more about Radix Connect](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/what-is-radix-connect) ↗",
  "infoLink_glossary_transactionfee": "## Transaction Fee\n\nEach time a [transaction](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) is submitted to the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork), a _very_ small fee (usually only a few cents) has to be paid to the network itself.\n\nThis fee must be paid in [XRD tokens](?glossaryAnchor=xrd) and is paid as a part of each transaction.\n\n---\n\nFor transactions you submit to the network in your [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet), you will see how much it will cost before you submit, and you can choose which [Account](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) you want to pay the fee from.\n\nTransactions fees on Radix are split into 3 parts.\n\n**Network fees**: These support Radix [node operators](?glossaryAnchor=validators) who validate transactions and secure the Radix Network. The size of network fees reflect the burden each transaction puts on the network.\n\n**Royalties**: These are set by developers who deploy code or run applications on the network. Royalties allow developers to collect a “use fee” every time their work is used as part of a transaction.\n\n**Tips**: These are optional payments users can make directly to validators to prioritize their own transactions during periods of high network demand. \n\n[Learn more about transaction fees](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/how-do-transaction-fees-work-on-radix) ↗",
  "infoLink_glossary_behaviors": "## Asset Behaviors\n\nAsset behaviors define the rules that were placed on a [token](?glossaryAnchor=tokens) or [NFT](?glossaryAnchor=nfts) when it was created. They ensure all users know exactly what actions can be performed on any asset. And they’re labeled in everyday language so everyone can read them, understand them and know the nature of the asset they’re holding.\n\n---\n\nThe [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) is built differently to all other blockchains. One of the great benefits of this is that assets – tokens and NFTs – are native to the ecosystem. So unlike on networks such as Ethereum, where tokens are not really tokens but just balances on a smart contract, assets on Radix act like real-life assets. With real-life assets of different kinds, you know who can create it, destory it, take it away from you or freeze it within your bank account. Similarly with Radix, you’ll always know how assets will behave and what someone can do to them.\n\nWhen anyone creates a token or NFT on Radix, there is a list of behaviors they can apply to them. Things like being able to increase the token’s supply, being able to change an NFT’s image and description, or being able to remove a token from someone’s account. There are plenty of valid reasons for why someone might want to do these things, but it’s always good to know if they can. \n\nJust tap into any token in the Radix Wallet to get a full list of its behaviors.\n\n[Learn more about the asset behaviors ↗](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/what-are-radix-asset-behaviors)",

This simply indicates that the dApp may add additional actions to your pre-authorization before submitting the transaction to the Radix Network.\n\nNot to worry - you are only approving and signing what you can see in your wallet. Nothing added by the dApp can do anything with your accounts and assets without your knowledge.",
  "infoLink_glossary_biometricspin": "## Biometrics/PIN\n\nA biometrics/PIN factor is a 24-word seed phrase protected and accessed via your phone's biometrics or PIN security feature. Unlike most crypto wallets, there isn't a single seed phrase controlling all of your stuff – it's just 1 type of factor you can use to protect [Accounts](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) and [Personas](?glossaryAnchor=personas) or use as part of multi-factor [Security Shields](?glossaryAnchor=securityshields).\n\nBecause this is the only kind of factor held on your phone, it won't automatically transfer if you move to a different phone with your [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet). Using a Security Shield for your Accounts and Personas enables easy transfer of wallet control without having to write down and enter a seed phrase. If you create Accounts or Personas with a biometrics/PIN factor, and you don't apply a Security Shield, you'll need to enter the seed phrase to recover access on a different phone.",
  "infoLink_glossary_passphrases": "## Passphrases\n\nA passphrase is a 24-word BIP39 seed phrase. Unlike with most crypto wallets though, it's a specific type of seed phrase that isn't held on your phone so it can't be accessed with the help of your phone's biometrics or PIN features. It must be typed in word by word every time you use it to sign [transactions](?glossaryAnchor=transactions). This means it must be written down and should be stored (ideally not electronically) in a secret location. For this reason, this factor source is best left to experienced users.\n\nIf you prefer to use a seed phrase held on this device for easy usage, like a typical crypto wallet, please see the [biometrics/PIN](?glossaryAnchor=biometricspin) factor type.",
  "infoLink_glossary_passwords": "## Passwords\n\nPassword can be used as a type of security factor in the [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet). A password can be useful to add additional security to your [Security Shields](?glossaryAnchor=securityshields) in combination with other factors. To be secure, your password must be at least 16-characters long and it should be impossible for someone else to guess. If you write it down, make sure you don't do this electronically and keep it stored in a safe place.\n\nPasswords on Radix are different from normal passwords because they're decentralized. They're not held in a central server or even in your Radix Wallet app. Through some cryptographic magic, the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) itself can check if your password is correct without storing it. It's provides the security of [web3](?glossaryAnchor=web3) with the easy functionality of web2.",
  "infoLink_glossary_arculus": "## Arculus Card\n\nArculus Cards are secure third-party \"hardware wallet\" cryptographic signing devices in a convenient credit card form factor. To use it, you only need to tap it to the NFC reader on your phone.\n\nUsing a hardware signing device like an Arculus Card provides strong security because it requires physical access to the card to use it. If you use it in a [Security Shields](?glossaryAnchor=securityshields), you can combine it with other factors you have so that even if the card is lost or stolen, your funds are safe and you can reconfigure the Shield to remove the lost Arculus Card, and carry on as before.

To use it, you need to connect it via USB to a computer with a linked [Radix Connector](?glossaryAnchor=radixconnector) browser extension. From here, you can approve signatures by following the Nano's on-screen instructions.\n\nUsing a hardware signing device like a Ledger Nano provides strong security because it requires physical access to the device to use it. If you use it in a [Security Shields](?glossaryAnchor=securityshields), you can combine it with other factors you have so that even if the device is lost or stolen, your funds are safe and you can reconfigure the Shield to remove the lost device from it.

  "infoLink_glossary_buildingshield": "## How your Security Shield is Built\n\nA good [Security Shield](?glossaryAnchor=securityshields) combines safety and reliability. No one else should be able to access it and even if you lose your phone you should always be able to recover access to your [Accounts](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) and [Personas](?glossaryAnchor=personas).\n\nYour [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) will help you by suggesting a good Shield configuration once you’ve added the required security factors. Once this is done, you can edit it to suit your requirements and the Radix Wallet has 3 rules in place to ensure those edits don't make your Shield unsafe or innaccessible.\n\n1. [Password](?glossaryAnchor=passwords) cannot be used alone. They are useful factors but aren't secure enough to be used by themselves.\n2. To make sure you won't lose access if you lose 1 of your factors, you must always have at least 2 factors options to start a Shield recovery.\n3. To make sure nobody can take away your Shield by stealing just 1 factor, if you are only using 1 factor for regular access, you cannot use that factor again for recovery. And you also cannot use the same factor to both start and confirm a recovery.\n\nOnce you've finalized the setup of factors for a Shield, you’ll be ready to apply it to your chosen Accounts and Personas on the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) with 1 or more [transactions](?glossaryAnchor=transactions).",
  "infoLink_glossary_securityshields": "## Security Shields\n\nSecurity Shields give users multi-factor access to their [Accounts](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) and [Personas](?glossaryAnchor=personas) while maintaining decentralization and full self-custody. They provide 2 critical functions. They allow users to rely on more than 1 security factor for regular access and for recoveries in the event that another security factor is lost.\n\nThe process to create a Shield is simple and once it’s finished, it can be applied to Accounts and Personas on the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) itself, providing robust and reliable security without compromising true trustless decentralization. There are no central servers that hold your Security Shield or secret keys – on Radix, it’s all done on the blockchain directly, so you're always in control. It's \"your keys, your crypto\", but without being stuck with 1 key you can't change.\n\n---\n\nShields are made up of 2 groups of factors.\n\n**Regular Access**\n\nThis part of your Security Shield defines the factors you'll use for normal usage, like signing [transactions](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) to withdrawing assets from your Accounts.\n\nWhen choosing your factors for regular access, consider how often you’ll be using them. If it’s every day, choose ones you can access easily. A single factor can be used, but it's recommended to use more than one for additional security. For example, a [password](?glossaryAnchor=passwords) is an easy second factor to add security for more sensitive Accounts.\n\nFor convenience, you'll also choose a single factor you'll use to prove ownerhip – like when you log in to [dApps](?glossaryAnchor=dapps) or if they request access to your Accounts.\n\n**Recovery**\n\nThis part of your Security Shield is made up of the factors that help you recover access to shielded Accounts and Personas in the event that you lose access to them or want to transfer control. For example, if you move your wallet to a new phone, you'll use the Shield's recovery feature to change the biometrics/PIN factor to a new one on your new phone.\n\nYou'll need to choose 1 or more factors that can start a recovery and 1 or more factors that can confirm the recovery. In most cases, you'll start and confirm the recovery in a single step, but in the worst case, a timed \"emergency fallback\" will let you start a recovery with just 1 factor and confirm it after a safe delay.\n\nYou can choose the time period for your emergency fallback factor. Make sure you choose a time period long enough that you'll be likely to open your [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) and cancel the recovery if anyone ever steals 1 of your factors and attempts to take control of your Accounts and Personas.\n\nYour Radix Wallet will help you build your Security Shield and once it’s finished, you’ll need to sign some transactions to apply it on the Radix Network to the Accounts and Personas of your choice.",
